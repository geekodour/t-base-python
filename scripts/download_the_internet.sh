set -euxo pipefail

# Add set -xeuo pipefail to the top of your script and run again. You'll get
# verbose logs of everything the script does, and it'll stop immediately if any
# command results in an error, instead of chugging along (the default).

# Once you've fixed it, remove the x â€” but leave the rest, and include it in every
# shell script you writer, forever. You'll thank me.
